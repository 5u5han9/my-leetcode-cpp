/**
 * You are playing the following Bulls and Cows game with your friend: You write down a number and
 * ask your friend to guess what the number is. Each time your friend makes a guess, you provide a
 * hint that indicates how many digits in said guess match your secret number exactly in both digit
 * and position (called "bulls") and how many digits match the secret number but locate in the wrong
 * position (called "cows"). Your friend will use successive guesses and hints to eventually derive
 * the secret number.
 *
 * Write a function to return a hint according to the secret number and friend's guess, use A to
 * indicate the bulls and B to indicate the cows.Â  Please note that both secret number and friend's
 * guess may contain duplicate digits.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: secret = "1807", guess = "7810"
 * Output: "1A3B"
 * Explanation: 1 bull and 3 cows. The bull is 8, the cows are 0, 1 and 7.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: secret = "1123", guess = "0111"
 * Output: "1A1B"
 * Explanation: The 1st 1 in friend's guess is a bull, the 2nd or 3rd 1 is a cow.
 *
 * Note: You may assume that the secret number and your friend's guess only contain digits, and
 * their lengths are always equal.
